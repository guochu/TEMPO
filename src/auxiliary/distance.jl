"""
    distance2(x, y)

Compute the squared distance between two arrays (or tensor networks `Dense1DTN`) of the same shape:

`‖x - y‖² = ‖x‖² + ‖y‖² - 2 Re⟨x, y⟩`; the absolute value is returned to avoid negative values from floating-point rounding.

Typically used to verify the accuracy of tensor network multiplication against a naive reference implementation. See also [`distance`](@ref).

"""
    distance(x, y)

The 2-norm distance between two arrays (or tensor networks `Dense1DTN`) of the same shape, equal to `sqrt(distance2(x, y))`.

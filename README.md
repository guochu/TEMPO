# Time evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method, elementary functionalities have been implemented, but more recent advances not included yet


## Todo list
- Support for multiple impurities (one can use a single large impurity currently, but this approach may be inefficient)
- Support for time-translational invariance (infinite MPS, PRL, 132, 200403 (2024) for example)
- Partial integration technique for multiple impurities (Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 033078 (2023))
- Support for continuous MPS technique (PRB 110, 045104 (2024))
